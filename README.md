# docspine-demo-platform

Demo source repository for the Docspine documentation aggregation demo. Contains documentation for services across the **identity** and **platform** domains.

This repo demonstrates that a single repository can contain services from different domains. Docspine aggregates by domain at build time — repo structure and domain grouping are independent concerns.
